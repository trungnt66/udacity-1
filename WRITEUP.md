### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

- App Service solution had easier workflow.
- App service is cheaper when compare with VM.
- VM has better scalability.

- I choose App Service solution instead of VM because:
  + Better cost.
  + App is simple, I do not need to use VM.
  + Azure take care alot for security control.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

- The application needs more control over current requirements. Example we need an application need higher scalabiltity.
- When I need to support more programing languages, example when Azure App Service not support that languages.
